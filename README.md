##2. Getting sources

git clone git://github.com/drone-pl/FullScreenProj.pl.git

You need to get libproc-processtable-perl libnet-dbus-pelr and I suggest that x11-utils & x11-xserver-utils is already installed.

Just run it and enjoy! It will daemonize right after start. For automation, add script to autostart folder, e.g. ~/.kde/Autostart.

##5. TODO

Add ability to configure application through GUI and config files.
Write man pages.
Add command-line options.
Create some artwork.
